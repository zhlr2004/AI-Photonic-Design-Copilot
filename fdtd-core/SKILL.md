# Solver-independent FDTD core

This skill is the common boundary used by `meep-fdtd-workflow` and
`lumerical-fdtd-workflow`. Solver APIs, units, templates, sessions, and license
details remain in their solver-specific skills.

## Required contracts

Validate platform documents against:

```text
../schemas/v1/contracts.schema.json
```

Every adapter consumes `SimulationContract` and emits `RunManifest` plus
`ValidationReport`.

## Completion states

- `generated`: model-building code exists; no real solver run completed.
- `executed`: solver output is readable; convergence is not established.
- `validated`: declared convergence and relevant physics checks pass.

Never promote a base-only run beyond `executed`.

## Canonical fields

Map solver-native names to these fields before common analysis:

```text
frequency
wavelength
reflectance
transmittance
absorption
field_e
field_h
mode_coefficients
q_factor
far_field
```

Record the native-to-canonical mapping in run metadata.

## Common execution contract

1. Validate the SimulationContract and reject unaccepted material assumptions.
2. Before writing solver code, obtain the G1 choice of single MPI process or
   multiple MPI processes and record the exact process count.
3. Verify environment availability without consuming a commercial license by
   default.
4. Generate a deterministic model in an isolated run directory.
5. Complete [checklists/simulation-review.md](checklists/simulation-review.md).
6. Obtain explicit G2 approval for `base_only` or
   `base_plus_convergence`.
7. Run a reduced smoke case before the production case.
8. Export raw arrays before computing derived quantities.
9. If approved, vary mesh, PML/padding, and run-control independently.
10. Run deterministic physics checks.
11. Emit the report described in
    [checklists/result-report.md](checklists/result-report.md).

## Convergence

Always retain proposed convergence cases in `SimulationContract`. Execute them
only after explicit approval.

Compare the requested observable with:

```text
norm(current - previous) / max(norm(current), machine_epsilon)
```

The tolerance belongs to the contract. Do not use a universal threshold.

## Common physics checks

Select only applicable checks:

- passive lossless structures: `R + T` or total outgoing power;
- mode-decomposed power versus total flux;
- symmetry-on versus symmetry-off reduced case;
- resonance frequency/Q stability;
- near-to-far versus direct field sampling;
- reciprocity or a known limiting case;
- cross-solver trend comparison when both mappings are equivalent.

## Utilities

Run common NPZ/JSON/CSV checks:

```text
python scripts/validate_results.py results.npz --rt-tolerance 0.05
```

Compare static Meep and Lumerical benchmark outputs:

```text
python benchmarks/compare_cross_solver.py meep.npz lumerical.npz
```

The comparison checks axes, energy balance, and spectral trend. It does not
require pointwise equality.
